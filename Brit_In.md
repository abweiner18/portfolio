# Forget Brexit; It’s Time to *Brit-In*
###### *By Anita Weiner, November 11, 2018*

At a recent get together, the 17-year old daughter of a friend told me that she doesn’t like musicals anymore. She spent the meal flexing her burgeoning socio-political consciousness muscles. Musicals are escapist, she revealed to me.

The midterms, the shootings, the President… with the country seemingly on a slow burn into deeper social, economic, and political division, who isn’t a sucker for a good, escapist musical right now? So you can imagine my surprise when I discovered the answer to all of our country’s woes, a solution so obvious and so elegant, singing and dancing right in front of me on stage at the Boston Opera House!

I saw *Hamilton*, the megahit musical currently taking the country by storm on a 20-city national tour. Or rather, I should say, I saw King George.

Hamilton’s King George is an Elton John-like creature, a glittering glam rock king gleefully singing dire warnings to a ‘70s pop beat about how we colonists will never succeed. And in that moment, the proverbial lightbulb went off (ok, it was probably his crown glittering in the stage lights) and I realized, my fellow Americans, that, *by George!* George is right. We colonies couldn’t pull it off, and after 242 years it’s time to throw out our 3-branch, 2-party government and throw back on our powdered wigs. Forget Brexit, it’s time for us to *Brit-In*.  

Forget about pre-existing conditions, high deductibles, and drug costs. In the United Kingdom, healthcare is universal and free. According to the latest [Gallup poll](https://news.gallup.com/poll/225383/uninsured-rate-steady-fourth-quarter-2017.aspx), 12.2 percent of Americans still do not have healthcare. And for those of us who do, we’re still paying significant out-of-pocket costs for care.  

But healthcare isn’t really free, you say. Those Brits pay for it through their exorbitant taxes. [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/may/27/tax-britons-pay-europe-australia-us) compared 2016 income tax rates of several countries and found that personal income tax rates of the U.S. and Great Britain were about the same. So, income tax is around same, and they get free healthcare? You’re *gobsmacked*, I know. What else do they get?

They get 28 days of paid vacation. England is one of the [top countries in vacation time](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/08/people-in-these-countries-get-the-most-paid-vacation-days/). 28 days. And what about college costs? Costs for British students studying in Britain is capped at around $12,000 per year, and those caps are even lower for students in Scotland and Ireland studying in their home countries. Oh, and did I mention that degrees in the UK are three-year programs, unlike the four-year programs here in the States? *Cha-ching*.

And the UK doesn’t have mass shootings. In the last two weeks alone we’ve witnessed tragic events in Pittsburgh and Thousand Oaks, CA. Several years ago, England changed its gun laws. The result has been, [according to the Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/gun-deaths-eliminated-america-learn-japan-australia-uk-norway-florida-shooting-latest-news-a8216301.html), “roughly 50 to 60 gun deaths a year in England and Wales, which have a population of 56 million. Compare that to the US, a country about six times as large that has more than 160 times as many gun-related homicides.”

Yes, I hear you whispering that it’s all about taxation without representation, right? It’s what we fought for, right? It’s true, if we become a colony again, we won’t have representation in Parliament. But come on, how much has Congress been working for you lately?

Take the most recent Trump tax cut. Businesses and the top 20% of earners were the big winners. In 1775, just before the *shot heard ‘round the world* rang out, the only tax we colonists were paying was one cent on a pound of tea. A trifle then... and now. Uh, is that offer still on the table?

Imagine with me... we’ll take afternoon tea with those cute little shortbread cookies. We’ll speak with smart, sexy British accents that automatically raise our IQs 50 points. And we get the soapy Royal Family to dote and gossip on.

But wait, you say. You’re *chuffed to bits* for the vacation time and healthcare. You can handle the *duffers* in Parliament and can’t wait to hoist up your Harry and Meghan flags. But *blimey*, mate, we just can’t do it. The divide is too large. There’s that elephant in the room, that one ultimate dealbreaker in what could have been the reunion to end all reunions: soccer.

*Bloody hell*.
