# Want to Avoid a Dangerous Chemo Side Effect? Talk to TINA
###### *By Anita Weiner, December 12, 2018*

Atlanta, GA – Neutropenia sounds scary -- and it is. It's a potentially fatal side effect of chemotherapy. But patients can significantly reduce their risk of neutropenia by simply talking to Tina. Tina is a healthcare professional. She’s extremely knowledgeable. She’s very clear, calm and sympathetic. And... she’s an app.

[TINA](https://www.preventcancerinfections.org/talkwithtina/) is an app launched Thursday by the [CDC Foundation](https://www.cdcfoundation.org/). It features a digitally-animated healthcare professional (named Tina, of course) who chats with chemo patients about neutropenia and how to avoid it. TINA stands for “Talking about Infection and Neutropenia Awareness.”  

The CDC Foundation is a non-profit organization created by Congress to fundraise and support the efforts of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Chemotherapy kills cancer cells, but it also kills white blood cells, a vital part of the body’s immune defenses. Patients undergoing chemotherapy have a much higher risk of getting an infection and not being able to fight it off. Neutropenia is the name given to this very serious side effect.

Neutropenia hospitalized more than 108,000 people in 2012 according to the latest available data. Infections and hospitalizations caused by neutropenia can cause delays in chemotherapy and in some cases, the infections lead to death. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in Massachusetts and nationally. According to the CDC, approximately 650,000 people undergo chemotherapy annually.

It might seem strange to talk about cancer with a computer, but TINA allows patients who tend to avoid difficult conversations with their "human" healthcare provider to be more open and receptive. When people talk to a machine, they “engage in less of what’s called impression management, so they reveal more intimate things about themselves,” said Jonathan Gratch, a computer scientist and psychologist at the University of Southern California’s Institute for Creative Technologies, in a recent Atlantic magazine article about the digital voice assistant revolution.

On the app, TINA welcomes you into her office and asks the patient how they’re doing. Some preprogrammed response options then appear on screen and TINA’s response is based upon what option the patient chooses. The “conversation” about neutropenia continues, guided by this series of questions and responses. Throughout it all, TINA provides vital information with a calm, reassuring bedside manner.

In fact, TINA's bedside manner is so impressive that TINA has been designed with a second function: to be an interactive training tool for health providers to improve their conversations with patients about neutropenia.
